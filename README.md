# Sheypoor frontend-challenge

The task is to implement a Top Tap Navigator

The User information that we need to collect is described in the User type:


There is a dummy `sdk` package(implemented in the /sdk folder) which exports a `loadData` function. This function returns a `Promise`.
Use it to simulate a request that get listing data. 
Ex:

```
import loadData from 'sdk'

loadData().then(console.log)

```

The focus should be on code style and the way you approach the problem implementation wise.
